## About me:
Although I am not yet experienced enough in web development, at this stage I like working with the visual components, interacting with the user, and seeing the result of my work. I would like to come up with a variety of interaction algorithms. This is why I am interested in the front-end.
## My skills:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git
## My code example:
```
function findShort(s){
  let arr = s.split(' ');
  let count = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
  for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i].length < count) {
      count = arr[i].length;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
findShort("bitcoin take over the world maybe who knows perhaps");
```
## Expirience:
* Ivan Petrichenko's front-end courses _in progress..._
* Completing assignments from my experienced web developer friend
## Education:
**Minsk State Higher Aviation College** 2015  
Electronic equipment maintenance engineer
## English level:
